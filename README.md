# dog-of-the-day-bot
A node.js script for fetching and posting a random Dog pic at 9am every ding dang day.

### Basic instructions (PENDING NEW INTEGRATION SOLUTION)
The script was originally pretty plug and play. Unfortunatly, Slack (legacy) tokens can no longer be generated as the API is deprecated. This means of integration was originally used to allow Slack workplace members who lack integration permissions to add the "bot" anyway. I will be investigating a new solution and will update (hopefully) when I find one.

**For HISTORICAL purposes only:** Originally, all you would need to do is generate a Slack token and add it to a simple object that is exported from a top level file, `config.js`. This object also housed a list of channels that the script would post to.
```
exports.config = {
  API_KEY: ‘workplace_api_key_here’,
  CHANNELS: [/*'dotdtest',*/ 'dog-of-the-day'], // I used a channel called #dotdtest for maintenance purposes. There are also logs generated by the script.
};
```
